# PANDEMICHAT

This is the finalized version of our project. We are team HealthNextDoor,
 and we would like to solve the problem "how might we better support patients 
 as they are hard to see a doctor in this difficult situation". We would like to use 
 this website to help patient with any symptoms.
 
 ## Features
 
 For the last Deliverable, we just developed 3 main functions, which can 
 be seen from the web navigation, Home, Login, and Discussion List. 
 And we also develop three core functions.
 
 ### Core Function
 
 1. Login 
 
        a. When you click into Login page, you will see the Login
            box, you can use login button log into our web. 
    e.g. try username: 741114898@qq.com, password: A123456a
        
        b. If you are not our user, you can click sign up button 
            to sign up your account.
    e.g. try to enter any username and password by yourself
 
        c. After you login or signup, page will link to the discussion board, which will display all the post. 
        
    
    
    
 2. Discussion Board
            
       
    For Patient
        a. When you click into an existed post listing in the discussion page,
           you will see the information in detail of that post. And you can reply
           to post if you think you can offer some help to the author.
           
        b. If you are sick, you can creat your own post so the doctor will offer you some medical instruction.
    
    For Docter
        a. you may reply to the cunrrent post so the patients can know what they should do in that particular situation. 
     
     
 3. Medical Survey
 
        a. filling up the survey would help the doctor to understand your symptoms better,
            you can use the symptoms' tag to spcify your symptom.
    
     e.g. fill up the survey with your personal information and symptoms' description
